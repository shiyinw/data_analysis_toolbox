# Jupyter Notebook

### Change the Theme

[GitHub]: https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes

```bash
pip install jupyterthemes
```

```bash
# select theme: onedork | grade3 | oceans16 | chesterish | monokai | solarizedl | solarizedd
jt -t chesterish
```

It is not compatible with my computer because of the missing of toolbar.

### nbextensions

```
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
jupyter contrib nbextension install --system
```
